# YOLO-LSN
An efficient and lightweight object detection algorithm for UAV aerial imagery, designed to accurately detect mining-induced surface cracks using an improved YOLOv10 framework with LDADH, SOFEP, and NWD modules.
# YOLO-LSN: Lightweight Small Object Detection Network for UAV Imagery

This repository contains the official implementation of **YOLO-LSN**, a lightweight and efficient object detection model tailored for detecting mining-induced surface cracks in UAV aerial imagery. The model is based on the YOLOv10 architecture and enhanced with three novel modules:

- **LDADH**: Lightweight Dynamic Alignment Detection Head  
- **SOFEP**: Small Object Feature Enhancement Pyramid  
- **NWD**: Normalized Wasserstein Distance regression loss
